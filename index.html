      <h2>Aim High, Soar High</h2>
      <p>More than a rhyming mantra, it's a <u>compact philosophy of aspiration and transcendence.</u></p>
      <p>In just four words, it fuses <strong>intentionality</strong> and <strong>momentum</strong>, urging students not merely to set lofty goals but to <strong>propel themselves beyond them.</strong></p>
      <p>The words capture the way our school nurtures curiosity and ambition, shaping students who don't just dream but act on those dreams.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(1, 95, 8);">Each time I speak those words, I'm reminded that I belong to an institution recognized as the pride of the southern sky, a place where curiosity is sharpened and ambitions take flight.</p>
      <p><mark>We carry our school's light beyond the horizon.</mark></p>
